# 👑 Ammi Abbu Ka Sacha Beta — Swiggy Live Order, Address & Cart Bot

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/hulm0408/ammi-abbu-ka-sacha-beta)

Telegram bot built for seamless Swiggy food ordering with real-time **Saved Address Fetching**, **Shared/Group Cart Fetching**, **Exact Address-Bound Checkout Billing**, **Auto Coupon Engine**, and **Render Docker Cloud Deployment**.

## 🚀 1-Click Render Deployment

1. Click **[Deploy to Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/hulm0408/ammi-abbu-ka-sacha-beta)** above *(or open **[Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)** -> **New +** -> **Web Service** -> select **`hulm0408/ammi-abbu-ka-sacha-beta`**)*.
2. Enter your **`BOT_TOKEN`** (from `@BotFather`) — set a strong **`BOSS_SECRET`** (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 16`) and `HEADLESS` (`true`) are already pre-configured.
3. Click **Apply / Deploy Web Service** — health check listens automatically on `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (`GET /` -> `200 OK`).

## 💬 Simple chat mode (default) — two links, one tap, tracking link

Customers no longer see topics, "Send to Beta", mobile-number prompts or any multi-step quiz.
The whole journey lives in the Telegram chat (no web app / mini app):

1. paste the Swiggy **Cart link + Address link** (one message or two),
2. the bot auto-picks the best account + max offer and shows **one bill card**,
3. tapping **✅ Confirm ₹amount** is the customer's consent — it is stored on the order
   (`customerConsentGiven`, `customerConsentAt`, `customerConsentBy`, `customerConsentVia`,
   `customerConsentAmount`) before any payment QR exists,
4. the payment QR arrives, the customer taps **✓ I have paid**,
5. the **real Swiggy tracking link** arrives once as its own bubble with a `🛵 Track on Swiggy`
   button (plus delivery OTP when Swiggy provides it).

Controls: `SIMPLE_CHAT_MODE=0` restores the older screens. Full details in
[`SIMPLE_CHAT_FLOW.md`](./SIMPLE_CHAT_FLOW.md); guarded offline by

## 📍 Address intake rule (URL-first)

A Swiggy "Share address" message is the **only** source of delivery data:

* `https://swiggy.onelink.me/JgkQ/...` and `https://www.swiggy.com/ofo/address/...` are resolved through Swiggy's
  shared-address API — receiver name, phone, street, city and GPS all come from that response.
* Text pasted next to the link (order-account block, cart receipt, forwarded header, "Address: ..." line) is
  **never** parsed into the delivery address, so a forwarded bill can't hijack the recipient's number or area.
* If the link cannot be resolved, the bot asks for a fresh link/pin instead of guessing from chat text.
* A plain street address (or Telegram GPS pin) is still accepted when the message contains **no** address link.
* The delivery contact is always the receiver's number; the ordering Swiggy account's number is never substituted.
* **Only the URL is used.** Telegram keeps markdown, so a real paste often looks like
  `link:[https://swiggy.onelink.me/JgkQ/kubail4a](https://swiggy.onelink.me/JgkQ/kubail4a)` followed by
  `Address: …` and `It is a one time use link and will be valid for 24 hours.` All URL capture goes through
  `link-utils.js` (`extractSharedUrls` / `normalizeSharedUrl` / `stripSharedLinks`), so the markdown wrapper,
  the duplicated copy and every line of marketing text are dropped. The same applies to restaurant/group-cart
  links (`swig.gy/gc/...`), so a cart share message can never be read as an address and vice versa.

Order cards render as a compact receipt: `Order Account` → `Your Cart` → `Delivering To` → items →
`Bill Summary` → `To Pay`.

## 💬 One card per chat (no message spam)

Ammi/Abbu used to get a separate bubble for every step. Now:

* when a cart/address link is accepted, the customer's pasted message **and** the stale prompt bubbles are deleted,
* a single card is edited in place — it shows the cart, the resolved address, the items and the one
  `[ › Send to Beta ]` action,
* after Send to Beta the **same** card is edited: best account + max offer are applied automatically and the
  card becomes the bill summary with **✓ Approve bill**,
* the max-discount bill summary is rendered into that card (`billSummaryDelivery: SINGLE_CARD`) instead of
  another message — a plain message is only used when the card was deleted,
* approving sends the official Swiggy payment QR, and the verified payment sends the real Swiggy tracking link.

Cart and address data are never shortened or guessed to save messages — only the chat bubbles are reduced.

## 🧾 Payment QR, prompts and who receives the summary

* **Personalised QR.** After the customer approves the bill, the QR is drawn by `generateNamedUpiQrPngBuffer`
  (orange header with the customer's name, the exact amount and the order id inside the image). If Swiggy
  returns a payment URL instead, that official link is forwarded; if neither exists, the configured
  `bossUpiId` is used so the customer still gets a scannable QR (`paymentQrKind` records which one).
* **No leaked HTML.** Every message that contains `<b>/<i>/<code>` sets `parse_mode: 'HTML'` — enforced by a
  test that walks each `reply`/`sendMessage`/`editMessageText` call in the bot sources.
* **Interactive prompts.** `Paste Cart Link` / `Paste Address Link` send exactly one `force_reply` prompt
  (keyboard + placeholder). When the link arrives the prompt and the pasted message are deleted, so the chat
  keeps a single card. Repeated taps replace the prompt instead of stacking them.
* **Send to Beta with missing data** deletes the previous card and any prompt, then asks only for the missing
  cart link or address.
* **Summary routing** (`resolveBillSummaryAudience`): a Boss-forwarded / Boss-entered order keeps the bill
  summary **inside the bot** (`BOSS_ONLY`, the Boss card is the summary). A customer's own *Send to Beta*
  order goes to **both** (`CUSTOMER_AND_BOSS`) — the customer gets the confirm card, the Boss card shows the
  same bill.

## 🦥 Boss Lazy Mode — one forward, one tap

Ammi/Abbu text the Boss on his personal chat. The Boss forwards that message into the bot and from there
he should not have to think. `lazy-order-pilot.js` makes that true:

| Problem before | What happens now |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Forward fetch failed"** | The forwarded text is stored on the order (`lastIntakeRawText`). Resolution is retried once automatically; if it still fails, the chat gets a **rescue card** — `↻ Retry fetch (same message)` — so nothing has to be forwarded again. Expired group carts still fail fast (no pointless retries). |
| **"Bot never asked me to confirm"** | No payment QR is created without an explicit tap. The bill card now leads with a single coloured button: **`✅ Confirm · for Ammi · ₹248`** (`lazy_confirm_<orderId>`). Auto-QR only bypasses it when `config.autoConfirmOrders === true` is set deliberately. |
| **"Best ID not selected"** | The automatic multi-probe pick is retried on transient/WAF errors, then a deterministic fallback ladder (`planAccountFallbacks`) walks every logged-in ID — 0-order → 0-active → the rest — and stops at the first live bill. Only a fully unusable vault returns to the Boss, on a card that says `BEST SWIGGY ID NAHI MILA` with `🔄 Best ID dobara try karo`. |
| **"No tracking link"** | After payment the existing poller pushes Swiggy's own link; the card also carries **`🔗 Tracking abhi`** (`lazy_track_<orderId>`), which force-scans every ID and always answers with either the genuine Swiggy link or the real `swiggy.com/orders` page plus a retry promise. No bot-side `/track/<id>` link is ever invented. |

Who the order is for is resolved from `config.familyMembers` (`setFamilyRole` → `Ammi`/`Abbu`), then the
forwarded name, then nicknames in the message (`mummy`, `papa`, …). That label is used on the confirm
button, the rescue card and the confirmation audit trail (`bossConfirmedAt`, `bossConfirmedBy`).

**Boss's whole workflow is now:** long-press Ammi's message → Forward → bot → tap **✅ Confirm** → scan the
QR. If Ammi sent the cart and the address as two messages, forward both — they pair into one order. If
anything breaks, the card itself carries the retry button.

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
npm test          # 131-scenario behavioural audit suite
npm run test:guards  # URL-only link intake, single-card chat, auto bill summary → QR → real tracking, /start smoke + static undefined-reference guard
npm run test:lazy    # Boss lazy mode: recipient detection, fetch retry, best-ID ladder, tracking fallback, confirm gate
```

`test:guards` fails if any bot source references an identifier that is never declared (the class of bug behind
`setUserMiniAppButton is not defined`).

## ⭐ Customer orders get the same auto-offer pipeline as forwarded ones

When a customer taps **Send to Beta** (or `Refresh status`), the bot now repeats the whole Boss-side pipeline
automatically, in the background:

1. resolve the live cart + delivery address,
2. scan every logged-in Swiggy account (`0-Order` first) for the best combination of coupon, free cash and
   free delivery,
3. lock that account + bill on the order (`cardStage: BILL_READY`, `autoOptimized: true`).

Nothing is charged or placed automatically. As soon as the max-discount bill is locked, the bot sends the
customer the **bill summary exactly once** (`billSummarySentAt` guard) with **✓ Approve bill** /
**! Something is wrong** buttons. Tapping *Approve* sends the official Swiggy payment QR/link straight to the
customer (no Boss step in between), consumes one slot and records `billApprovedByUser`.

After payment is verified the customer receives the **real Swiggy tracking link** that Swiggy itself returned.
The bot never substitutes its own `/track/<orderId>` page: if Swiggy has not published a link yet, the message
says so (with a plain `swiggy.com/orders` shortcut) and the tracking poller pushes the exact link later.

If no free account is available the order simply stays pending and the reason is shown on the Boss card
(`Auto offers: …`), so Boss can retry with **★ Auto Max Coupon**. Boss's *Send Bill Summary* button is now a
manual **resend** of that same summary — it can never bill the customer twice.
